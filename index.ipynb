    "Now that you've learned the fundamentals of writing SQL queries, it's time to level up! One of the most powerful aspects of SQL is their *relational* nature, meaning that they not only store data, they store relationships between different tables of data. In this section you will learn to use the `JOIN` clause and *subquery* concept to write queries that span multiple tables. Then at the end you will complete some SQL practice specifically intended to prepare you for the kinds of SQL questions you're likely to see in technical interviews."

    "Let's say that you've been hired by a big and important company to handle the payroll for all of their employees. Every two weeks, you need to look up each and every employee and how much they get paid. You need to send them a check *and* send a notice of that check to their manager. (They have a very flat hierarchy, where everyone is either a manager or a regular employee. Managers do not have managers and regular employees do not manage anyone.)\n",
    "\n",

    "In such a situation, we would need a place to store information about all of the managers and employees. Using a spreadsheet, your storage system might look something like this:\n",

But it doesn't have enough information for you to be able to send notices to employees' managers, since it just says who is an employee and who is a manager, but not the relationships.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. There is some redundancy and wasted space. We don't actually need the `Manager?` column, since we can just check whether there is a name in the `Manager Name` column...but maybe we don't want to remove that since accidentally putting a manager name in the wrong place could mark someone as a regular employee when they're actually a manager.\n",
    "2. This is not a very robust system if anything changes. What if we get another manager who is also named Steve? Maybe you could enter the new Steve as \"Steve H.\", and you would just need to remember that \"Steve\" refers to the one who was there first.\n",
    "3. Or, what if Steve decides he wants to rebrand himself and start going by Steven instead? (You can also think of other reasons why someone would change their legal name.) Then you would need to find all places in the spreadsheet that say \"Steve\" and replace them with \"Steven\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really only had 5 total employees, it would be manageable to do this work \"by hand\" and just remember what you did. But if you had hundreds or thousands of employees, or you were working with a team of payroll professionals instead of by yourself, you can imagine how this system could get unmanageable pretty quickly!"
